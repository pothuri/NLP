Skoda Auto India surprised us earlier this week at the unveiling of the Kylaq by announcing the entry-level price of the sub-four-metre SUV. The model, which is priced from Rs. 7.89 lakh (ex-showroom) onwards, will be launched in India on 2 December. The carmaker will also commence bookings of its most affordable offering in India on the same date.We have now got our hands on the colour options and variant details of the new Kylaq ahead of its variant-wise price reveal. The Nexon rival will be offered in a total of five colours across four variants.
Customers purchasing the new Kylaq will be able to choose from five paints, namely Olive Gold, Tornado Red, Carbon Steel, Brilliant Silver, and Candy White. Furthermore, the four variants on offer will be Classic, Signature, Signature+, and Prestige.
The 2024 Kylaq gets the 1.0-litre, three-cylinder, TSI turbo-petrol engine, which is the sole motor on offer. Tuned to produce 114bhp and 178Nm, it will be available with six-speed manual and torque converter transmissions. The deliveries of the model are scheduled to begin in 2025, and you can read the finer details about it on our website.
